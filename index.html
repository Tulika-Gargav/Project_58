        <p>I am a foodie personüòÅ!Earlier,I was like all the day 'mumma plz order food from outside na!Then my mumma said 'no' already you are gaining weight day by day.Then after 'n' after getting rejection made me learn how to cook food.
          Then when I entered kitchen for the very first time for cooking I made maggi and the result of the maggi is very very dry and then slowly I started cooking many small dishes, day by day little-little mistakes made me a little cook.
          <br>
          So, this was my story of noob to finally a cook!</p>
